# NLP- (Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews)
- It is a simplest way to know whether the product is having a **positive reviews or negative reviews** based on the
customers tweets & ratings to the particular product.
- Created some amazing visualizations and **wordClouds** by **web-scrapping** 100 pages of the amazon in python for all the
tweets after removing the **stopwords, punctuations, emojis**, etc.
- Used various **machine learning** algorithms like **SVC, KNN, Bagging Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost** & deployed using
streamlit.
